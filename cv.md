### About me:
My name is __Mykyta__, I was born and live in _Kyiv, Ukraine_. I have a goal to learn how to develop *web applications*, *websites* and *online stores* at a **high level**.

I consider **perseverance** and **self-organization** to be one of my strengths. My qualities are perfectly described by a quote:
> “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.”
> Winston Churchill

**My work experience:**
I worked at *IT-Tour* as a **web developer at the WordPress CMS** from October 2021 to February 2022

**My responsibilities:** creating sites for sale using WordPress layouts, technical support for the company's clients (those who bought a site from us). Also, it was necessary to place automatic modules on client sites (minimal work with *javascript* code)
