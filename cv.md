### About me:
My name is __Mykyta__, I was born and live in _Kyiv, Ukraine_. I have a goal to learn how to develop *web applications*, *websites* and *online stores* at a **high level**.

I consider **perseverance** and **self-organization** to be one of my strengths. My qualities are perfectly described by a quote:
> “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.”
> Winston Churchill

**My work experience:**
I worked at *IT-Tour* as a **web developer at the WordPress CMS** from October 2021 to February 2022

**My responsibilities:** creating sites for sale using WordPress layouts, technical support for the company's clients (those who bought a site from us). Also, it was necessary to place automatic modules on client sites (minimal work with *javascript* code)

### My skills:
1. HTML & CSS
    1. Bootstrap
    2. Flexbox
    3. Adaptive markup
2. PhP - basic knowledge
3. Python - basic knowledge
4. VS Code & DevTools
5. WinSCP

### Code examples:
**From Codewars:**
```javascript
multiply = function (a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

### My projects:
[First site at work](http://dev16.wp.ittour.com/site52/)
On this project, I only needed to use CSS and a little knowledge of PHP to correct small inaccuracies. Also, I had to work with hosting and MYSQL database. 

[Last site at work](http://dev16.wp.ittour.com/site58/)
I think that this project gave me a clear understanding of where I want to go next. At this stage, I was already working with basic PHP operations, using devtools confidently to view non-working scripts.
